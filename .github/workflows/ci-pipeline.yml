name: CI Pipeline

# The CI pipeline runs whenever a pull request that modifies a file in 
# the src directory or the pipelines config itself is opened, synchronized
# (i.e., updated due to a new push to the branch that is tracked by the pull
# request) or reopened. If just the README or documentation changes, the
# pipeline does not have to run.
#
# When such a pull request is merged the resulting `push` event on the master
# branch triggers another run of the CI pipeline. This is necessary because
# there could be changes to the master branch that are not compatible with the
# pull request but don't prevent fast-forward merging.
